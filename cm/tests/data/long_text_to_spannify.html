	goods are suspected of infringing intellectual property rights, within the meaning of this<br />
	agreement, when they are imported, exported, in-transit or in other situations where the<br />
	goods are under customs supervision.<br />
	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of this section, &ldquo;goods infringing an intellectual property right&rdquo;<br />
	means goods infringing any of the intellectual property rights covered by TRIPS 22 .<br />
	However, Parties may decide to exclude from the scope of this section, certain rights<br />
	other than trade marks, copyrights and GIs when [not protected exclusively by<br />
	copyright and trade mark systems and] [protected by [non-product- or sector-specific]<br />
	[registration] sui generis systems.]<br />
	3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Parties shall provide for the provisions related to border measures to be applied<br />
	[at least ]in cases of trade mark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. [Parties may<br />
	provide for such provisions to be applied in other cases of infringement of intellectual<br />

	19<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a Party has dismantled substantially all controls over movement of goods across its border with<br />
	another Party with which it forms part of a customs union, it shall not be required to apply the provisions<br />
	of this Section at that border.<br />
	[20 Each Party shall implement the obligations in respect of importation and exportation set out in this<br />
	Section so as to be applied to shipments of goods consigned to {a local party/a party in the territory} but<br />
	destined for outside the territory of the Party].<br />
	21<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; No Party shall be obliged to apply this section to any goods that do not infringe an intellectual property<br />
	right held within the territory of that Party]. [Negotiator&rsquo;s note: Study moving to General Provisions<br />
	section.]<br />
	[22 The provisions of this section shall also apply to confusingly similar trademark goods [ , which means<br />
	any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is similar to the<br />
	trademark validly registered in respect of such or similar goods where there exists a likelihood of<br />
	confusion on the part of the public between the trademark borne and the trademark validly registered, and<br />
	that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country in<br />
	which the procedures set out in this Section are invoked.]<br />

	relevant information to the competent authorities.<br />
	ARTICLE 2.6: APPLICATION BY RIGHT HOLDER<br />
	Option 1<br />
	1. Each Party shall provide procedures for import [and in-transit23 ] shipments and [may]<br />
	[shall] provide procedures for export shipments, by which right holders may request the<br />
	competent authorities to suspend release 24 of suspected counterfeit trademark goods 25<br />
	and suspected pirated copyright goods 26 [goods suspected of infringing an intellectual<br />
	property right]into free circulation.<br />
	23<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of this Section, in-transit goods means goods under &ldquo;Customs transit&rdquo; and under<br />
	&ldquo;transhipment&rdquo;. &ldquo;Customs transit&rdquo; means the Customs procedure under which goods are transported<br />
	under Customs control from one Customs office to another. &ldquo;Transhipment&rdquo; means the Customs<br />
	procedure under which goods are transferred under Customs control from the importing means of<br />
	transport to the exporting means of transport within the area of one Customs office which is the office of<br />
	both importation and exportation.]<br />
	[24For the purpose of this Section, where the competent authorities suspend the release of suspected<br />
	counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods, the authorities shall not permit the goods to be released<br />
	into free circulation, exported, or subject to other customs procedures, except in exceptional<br />
	circumstances.]<br />
	25<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of this Section, counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging,<br />
	bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of<br />

	procedures set out in this Section are invoked.<br />
	[It is to be understood that there shall be no obligation to apply such procedures to imports of goods put<br />
	on the market in another country by or with the consent of the right holder.]<br />

	the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production<br />
	and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have<br />
	constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country in which the<br />
	procedures set out in this Section are invoked.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11<br />

	competent authorities to suspend the release of goods suspected of infringing<br />
	intellectual property rights.]<br />
	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The competent authorities shall require a right holder requesting the procedures<br />
	described in paragraph 1 to provide adequate evidence to satisfy themselves that, under<br />
	the laws of the Party providing the procedures, there is prima facie an infringement of<br />
	the right holder&#39;s intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that<br />
	may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder&rsquo;s knowledge to make the<br />
	suspected infringing goods reasonably recognizable by the competent authorities. The<br />
	requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to<br />
	the procedures described in paragraph 1.<br />
	3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Party shall provide for applications to suspend the release of suspected<br />
	infringing goods that apply to all goods 27 under customs control in its territory and<br />
	remain applicable to multiple [or in the alternative specified] shipments. Each Party<br />
	may provide that, at the request of the right holder, the application to suspend the<br />
	release of goods may apply to selected points of entry and exit under customs control.<br />
	These applications for suspension shall remain applicable for a period of not less than<br />
	[one year][or sixty days] from the date of application, or the period of protection of the<br />
	relevant intellectual property rights under the laws of the Party providing border<br />
	measures under this Section, whichever is shorter. Each Party may permit a right holder<br />
	to specify that an application to suspend remain applicable for a period of less than [one<br />
	year][or sixty days].<br />
	4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The competent authorities shall inform the applicant within a reasonable period<br />
	whether they have accepted the application. Where the competent authorities have<br />
	accepted the application, they shall also make known to the applicant the period of<br />
	validity of the application.<br />
	5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Party may provide, where the applicant has abused the process, or where<br />
	there is due cause, that an application may be denied, suspended, or voided.<br />

	Option 1<br />
	1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Party [may] [shall] provide that its customs authorities may act upon their<br />
	own initiative, to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or<br />
	suspected pirated copyright goods with respect to imported, [exported] [, or in-transit]<br />
	goods including suspected counterfeit trademark goods or suspected pirated copyright<br />
	goods admitted to, withdrawn from, or located in free trade zones [goods suspected of<br />
	infringing an intellectual property right]. [Each Party [may][shall endeavor to] provide<br />

	shipments, each Party shall provide that where shipments are exported from that Party,<br />
	or shipments are in-transit through that Party, it shall cooperate to provide all available<br />
	information to the destination Party, upon request of the destination Party, to enable<br />
	effective enforcement against shipments of infringing 28 goods.]<br />
	ARTICLE 2.9: SECURITY OR EQUIVALENT ASSURANCE<br />
	Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require<br />
	a right holder requesting procedures described under Article 2.6 to provide a reasonable<br />
	security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent<br />
	authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or<br />
	equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. Each<br />
	Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold<br />
	the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the<br />
	release of the goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the good [is<br />
	not a counterfeit trademark good or a pirated copyright good] [does not infringe<br />
	intellectual property rights covered by this section]. Only in exceptional circumstances<br />
	[or pursuant to a judicial order] may a Party permit a defendant to post a bond or other<br />
	security to obtain possession of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or suspected<br />
	pirated copyright goods.<br />

	Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which competent authorities may<br />

	goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid<br />
	any harm to the right holder.] [or that they be disposed of outside the channels of<br />
	commerce in such a way as to preclude injury to the right holder, except in exceptional<br />
	circumstances.]<br />
	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark<br />
